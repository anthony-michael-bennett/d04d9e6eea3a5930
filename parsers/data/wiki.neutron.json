It results from the supernova explosion of a massive star—combined with gravitational collapse—that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Surpassed only by black holes, neutron stars are the second smallest and densest known class of stellar objects. Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometers and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses (M☉). Stars that collapse into neutron stars typically have an initial total mass between 10 and 25 M☉ or possibly more for those that are especially rich in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.",
